# SkellyAssemblyGame
A really basic 2D game made with Assembly and WinAPI, the game is about a skeleton inside a dungeon, there is not much gameplay wise, but you can take damage from the spikes and the "evil skelly" that is a pretty basic enemy with AI, likewise you can heal by picking milk, bones, and skeletons from the floor, if you happen to die you can come back to life by finding a full skelleton.

This project was developed as a class asignment for the Assembly class in the "Facultad de Ciencias Fisico Matemáticas" in "Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León" in the JAN-JUN 2019 semester.
This project was showcased in the Expo LMAD of June 2019.
